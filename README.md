Trello-task inspired App

A task management app that allows new columns and tasks to be added and organised. This was a timed technical challenge that I had four hours to complete, there was less weight behind the use of styling for this particular project.

Features

Add a new task: New tasks can be created.

Add a new column: New columns for the board can be created.

Edit an existing task: Tasks that are already visible can be edited.

Remove a task: Tasks that are displayed can be removed.

Local storage for columns.

With additional time, I would look to add a feature to remove a column via a button without the need for 'localStorage.removeItem("columns");'
Additionally, adding persistent state for cards so that will not clear on re-render.
