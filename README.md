Trello-inspired App

A simple Trello-style task app built with React & Ts.
Users can create, edit and move cards between columns.
New columns can be created and persistent state using local storage.

"Add Task" to create a new task.
"edit" a task by selecting "Edit" and "save"

If you wish to remove local storage columns, please use 'localStorage.removeItem("columns");' in console.
